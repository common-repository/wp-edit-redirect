Allows you to add "/wp-edit/" to the end of a page or post URL to redirect to the admin. Quick access to the backend to make changes on the fly!

Example: 

<strong>https://example.com/hello-world/wp-edit/</strong> redirects to <strong>https://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=1action=edit</strong>

<strong>https://example.com/sample-page/wp-edit/</strong> redirects to <strong>https://example.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=2&action=edit</strong>

After installation and activation, go to any post or page, add "/wp-edit/" (without quotes) to the URL, and it'll redirect you back to the admin edit page to edit the post or page.
